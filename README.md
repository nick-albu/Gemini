# About Gemini

Here's a link to a short demo https://www.loom.com/share/bc83fa2cf2bb46ec8478b61da169fa01

This project was created with JavaScript, React, Scss, MongoDB, Express and Node.

## Getting Started with Gemini

For project setup, download the repository and run `npm install` on both client and server folders.

Once those are installed run `npm start` on the client folder and `npx nodemon index.js` on the server folder.

You're both added to MongoDB as Database Admins. The link to my clusters is below, I'm not sure if you'll need that or if the email invite will provide it.

## Project Notes

The data stored in MongoDB can be confusing at first with my data structure.

Each result in the collection is either a template or a workout but it is not evident at first glace.

Each result will have template data with empty workout data, or workout data with empty template data.

This is built this way because I was only able to provide a single schema.

## Final Words

Thanks so much guys, you've made this experience amazing.

If you have any questions at all or anything is unclear please reach out to me.
